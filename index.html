    <h1>Totally Fungible Tokens</h1>
    <p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are an exciting new application of 
      Blockchain technology that allows us to burn down a rainforest every 
      time we want to trade a string representing an artist's signature 
      on a creative work.</p>
    <p>Many folks are eagerly turning JPGs, text files, and even Tweets into NFTs,
      but since not all of us <em>have</em> a convenient rainforest to destroy,
      <a href="https://thedailywtf.com">The Daily WTF</a> is happy
    to offer at alternative, the <strong>Totally Fungible Token</strong></p>
    <h2>What Is a Totally Fungible Token?</h2>
    <p>A TFT is a unique identifier which we can generate for any file or group of files. It combines the actual data in the file(s) with a Universally Unique Identifier, and then condenses that data using a SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This guarantees that you have a unique token which represents that you have created a unique token for that data.
    </p>
    <h2>How is this better than an NFT?</h2>
    <p>There are a few key advantages that TFTs offer. First, they're computationally very cheap to make, allowing even a relatively underpowered computer participate actively in the token ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, this breaks all dependencies on the blockchain, meaning
      that you <em>don't</em> need to use or spend cryptocurrency to create, purchase, or trade these tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most important: much like NFTs, a TFT is absolutely worthless, but we're not promoting these as some sort of arcane investment instrument, so there won't be any sort of bubble. The value of your TFT will remain essentially zero, for the entire life of your TFT. There is no volatility.

      <h1>Generate a TFT</h1>
      <p>Use the buttom below to browse for a file on your computer, and this will generate a unique token showing that you generated a unique token. Feel free to share, sell, or trade these tokens with your friends! No information about your files is in the token, so it's guaranteed to be completely meaningless! Give it away, sell it,just write it down on a napkin, your TFT is yours to use as you please!
